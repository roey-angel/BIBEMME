	abstract = {Although ephemeral streams constitute critical natural resources in dryland environments, water regulations and monitoring protocols typically focus on perennial streams, andmay not always be appropriate for characterizing intermittent systems. The article presents findings froma comprehensive evaluation of environmental conditions in two ephemeral transboundary streams: the {Hebron/Besor} and {Zomar/Alexander.} The streams are representative of numer- ous watersheds which originate in Palestinian land and flow into Israel. Transboundary streams in the region exhibit high concentrations of point and non- point sources of {pollution.Many} of the region{\textquoteright}s streams that in the past had no flow except for isolated storm incidents have emerged as perennial streams, channelling raw or partially treated industrial or municipal wastes. Management of these natural resources constitutes a unique challenge because of the complex local political circumstances. The article presents chemical and biological monitoring results, identifying high levels of non-point source nutrient runoff during rainfall events and high percolation of contaminated streamwater during its flow that should be addressed in future restoration strategies. The practical challenges associated with the monitoring of ephemeral streams are also discussed with suggestions for future studies and management efforts.},

The extremely degraded water quality conditions were traced to a variety of point and non-point pollution sources. This article summarizes the team{\textquoteright}s recommendations for futuremanagement activities if a coordinated rehabilitation effort is to be {successful.A} common restoration strategy should include transboundary planning that encompasses the entirewatershed,with reduction in phosphorus loadings being a top shared priority. The sides should agree on common {\textquoteleft}in-stream{\textquoteright} standards and pollution reduction goals. Pollution reduction strategies must focus on eliminating contaminants at the source, rather than continuing present interventions that attempt to mitigate or treat pollutants after they are already in the stream. Non-point source controls, especially for agricultural runoff, have not been a priority until now, but must be adopted for water quality objectives to be met. Only through a joint rehabilitation strategy will progress be made in restoring the quality of these important natural resources.},

@article{eldridge1993cryptogam,
	abstract = {The response of infiltration to large changes in cryptogam cover was studied at three sites in a semiarid woodland in eastern Australia. The sites varied markedly in vegetation cover, soil physical condition, and degree of erosion, and represented a gradient from high condition (class 1) to low condition (class 3). Infiltration was markedly higher on sites with a high surface condition, but changes in cryptogam cover had little effect on infiltration. Infiltration rate on the degraded class 3 surfaces showed a significant positive response to cryptogam cover. Differences in the hydrological responses to cryptogam cover are attributed to differences in soil physical properties, particularly porosity and aggregate stability, and the different pathways by which infiltrating water accesses the soil profile. The results suggest that the role of cryptogam cover in controlling infiltration increases as soil surface condition declines.},

In recent years, however, this has begun to change. Cultivation-independent studies have revealed that a few bacterial phyla predominate in the phyllosphere of different plants and that plant factors are involved in shaping these phyllosphere communities, which feature specific adaptations and exhibit multipartite relationships both with host plants and among community members. Insights into the underlying structural principles of indigenous microbial phyllosphere populations will help us to develop a deeper understanding of the phyllosphere microbiota and will have applications in the promotion of plant growth and plant protection.},

@article{liu2012microbial,
	abstract = {Rice paddies are one of the most important sources of {CH4} emission from the terrestrial ecosystem. A Free-air {CO2} Enrichment {(FACE)} experiment, which included a soil warming treatment, was conducted in a rice paddy at Shizukuishi, Japan. In this study, the changes in {CH4} emission from a rice paddy, caused by global climate change, were explored in relation to the structural changes that have occurred in the methanogenic archaeal communities found in the soil and roots. The composition of the archaeal community was examined by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism {(T-RFLP)} using the {16S} {rRNA} gene, while its abundance was measured by real-time {PCR} using the methyl coenzyme M reductase {(mcrA)} gene. The archaeal community in the roots showed considerable change, characterized by the dominance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens and a corresponding decrease in acetoclastic methanogens. Seasonal changes in {CH4} flux were closely related to the changes in methanogen abundance in the roots. Elevated {CO2} caused an increase in root mass, which increased the abundance of methanogens leading to a rise in {CH4} emissions. However, soil warming stimulated {CH4} emissions by increasing {CH4} production per individual methanogen. These results demonstrated that climate warming stimulates {CH4} emission in a rice paddy by altering the abundance and activity of methanogenic archaea in the roots.},

@article{angel2012effectof,
	abstract = {As atmospheric {CO2} levels continue to rise researchers now identify concomitant changes in plant biomass and diversity, which are postulated to alter the quality and quantity of the organic carbon entering the soil. In anoxic soils, {CH4} is the end product of the degradation of organic carbon and the system's terminal electron sink. Some soils (such as wetlands) are usually waterlogged and therefore constitute permanent {CH4} sources, while others (hydromorphic soils) are only occasionally saturated with water and alternate between acting as net {CH4} sources or sinks. Since methanogenesis is ultimately dependent on soil organic carbon, we hypothesized that a long term alteration of the latter will cause changes in type and magnitude of the former. To test this, we studied the effect of 10 years of atmospheric {CO2} enrichment on the methanogenic potential and community in a hydromorphic temperate grassland soil at the experimental Free Air Carbon dioxide Enrichment {(FACE)} site in Giessen, Germany. While all soils demonstrated methanogenic potential, we detected no significant changes in {CH4} production rates, lag times, methanogenic pathways, diversity, or population sizes in soils that were exposed to either 20 or 30\% elevated ambient {CO2.} Our findings suggest that the methanogenic potential of the soil and the methanogenic community might be insensitive to changes in atmospheric {CO2} concentrations, at least not on a decadal timescale. Thus, if our results can be extrapolated to other temporarily flooded or even wetland ecosystems, the often-observed increase in {CH4} emissions under elevated {CO2} may simply be due to an increase in labile-C input via living root and increasing fresh litter deposition, but not due to shifts in the microbial population characteristics. This could make it easier to model and extrapolate the global effect of elevated {CO2} on terrestrial {CH4} emissions.},

However, we found methanogens of the genera Methanosarcina and Methanocella to be present in many types of upland soils (including dryland soils) sampled globally. These methanogens could be readily activated by incubating the soils as slurry under anoxic conditions, as seen by rapid methane production within a few weeks, without any additional carbon source. Analysis of the archaeal {16S} ribosomal {RNA} gene community profile in the incubated samples through terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism and quantification through quantitative {PCR} indicated dominance of Methanosarcina, whose gene copy numbers also correlated with methane production rates. Analysis of the {?13C} of the methane further supported this, as the dominant methanogenic pathway was in most cases aceticlastic, which Methanocella cannot perform. Sequences of the key methanogenic enzyme methyl coenzyme M reductase retrieved from the soil samples before incubation confirmed that Methanosarcina and Methanocella are the dominant methanogens, though some sequences of Methanobrevibacter and Methanobacterium were also detected. The global occurrence of only two active methanogenic archaea supports the hypothesis that these are autochthonous members of the upland soil biome and are well adapted to their environment.},

@article{angel2011activation,
	abstract = {Methanogenesis is traditionally thought to occur only in highly reduced, anoxic environments. Wetland and rice field soils are well known sources for atmospheric methane, while aerated soils are considered sinks. Although methanogens have been detected in low numbers in some aerated, and even in desert soils, it remains unclear whether they are active under natural oxic conditions, such as in biological soil crusts {(BSCs)} of arid regions. To answer this question we carried out a factorial experiment using microcosms under simulated natural conditions. The {BSC} on top of an arid soil was incubated under moist conditions in all possible combinations of flooding and drainage, light and dark, air and nitrogen headspace. In the light, oxygen was produced by photosynthesis. Methane production was detected in all microcosms, but rates were much lower when oxygen was present. In addition, the {?13C} of the methane differed between the oxic/oxygenic and anoxic microcosms. While under anoxic conditions methane was mainly produced from acetate, it was almost entirely produced from {H2/CO2} under oxic/oxygenic conditions. Only two genera of methanogens were identified in the {BSC-Methanosarcina} and Methanocella; their abundance and activity in transcribing the {mcrA} gene (coding for methyl-{CoM} reductase) was higher under anoxic than oxic/oxygenic conditions, respectively. Both methanogens also actively transcribed the oxygen detoxifying gene catalase. Since methanotrophs were not detectable in the {BSC}, all the methane produced was released into the atmosphere. Our findings point to a formerly unknown participation of desert soils in the global methane cycle.},

	abstract = {Methanogens are known to inhabit not only the anaerobic bulk soil but also the rhizosphere of rice plants. The release of root exudates, a major carbon source for {CH4} production in the rhizosphere, is closely coupled to plant photosynthesis. In the present study we hypothesized that the diel cycle of plant photosynthetic activity may shape the structure and function of methanogens in the rhizosphere of rice. We performed a field experiment to determine the diel dynamics of methanogen {mcrA} and their transcripts in the rhizosphere and bulk soil. The chemistry of {NH4+}, {NO3-}, {SO42-} and {Fe(II)} in the rice rhizosphere remained constant over a diel sampling. The {mcrA} copy number and their transcripts were greater in the rice rhizosphere compared with the bulk soil, indicating the enhanced activity of methanogens in the rhizosphere. The hydrogenotrophic Methanomicrobiales in particular increased in the rhizosphere whereas Methanosarcinaceae were more abundant in the bulk soil. Both the phylogenetic affiliation and copy numbers of methanogen {mcrA} in the rice rhizosphere did not display diel dynamics. The {mcrA} transcripts, however, significantly increased in the night compared with the daytime. The diel pattern of physical factors like temperature appeared not to affect the methanogen dynamics. The response of {mcrA} transcripts is probably due to the plant attributes, which release less O2 from roots in the night and hence stimulate the methanogen gene transcription and activity compared with the daytime.},

	abstract = {Rice paddies are one of the most important sources of {CH4} emission from the terrestrial ecosystem. A Free-air {CO2} Enrichment {(FACE)} experiment, which included a soil warming treatment, was conducted in a rice paddy at Shizukuishi, Japan. In this study, the changes in {CH4} emission from a rice paddy, caused by global climate change, were explored in relation to the structural changes that have occurred in the methanogenic archaeal communities found in the soil and roots. The composition of the archaeal community was examined by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism {(T-RFLP)} using the {16S} {rRNA} gene, while its abundance was measured by real-time {PCR} using the methyl coenzyme M reductase {(mcrA)} gene. The archaeal community in the roots showed considerable change, characterized by the dominance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens and a corresponding decrease in acetoclastic methanogens. Seasonal changes in {CH4} flux were closely related to the changes in methanogen abundance in the roots. Elevated {CO2} caused an increase in root mass, which increased the abundance of methanogens leading to a rise in {CH4} emissions. However, soil warming stimulated {CH4} emissions by increasing {CH4} production per individual methanogen. These results demonstrated that climate warming stimulates {CH4} emission in a rice paddy by altering the abundance and activity of methanogenic archaea in the roots.},
